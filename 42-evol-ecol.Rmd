# Thurs Mar 31: Rmarkdown

Assigned March 31, due April 5

Today we are going to learn how to do word processing in R. This gives you another option for word processing, even though you might ultimately still prefer Microsoft Word or another software.

Some advantages of Rmarkdown are the ability to integrate your figures, code, and text. It is also easy to write in-text math, and you have a variety of output options including .html, .pdf, and .docx. The goal for the next two classes is to redo the assignment from Friday March 25, but to do the write-up in Rmarkdown. 

1. You will need to install the Rmarkdown package, related packages pandoc, and tinytex. For instructions see [here](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/installation.html).

2. Read the basics for Rmarkdown [here](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/basics.html)
