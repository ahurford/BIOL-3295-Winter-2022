## Questions

1. What is the equation for continous time logistic growth in its _classic form_? Define all the symbols in the equation by writing their meanings in words. Can $K$ be negative? [3 marks]

1. What does dN/dt mean? [1 mark]

1. Assume that $N < K$. For what values of $r$ will $N$ increase over time? [1 mark]

1. Assume that $r > 0$ and $K > N$. Will $N$ increase or decrease in size over time? [1 mark]

1. Assume that $r,K \neq 0$. For what values of $N$ is the population size constant (i.e., not changing over time)? [2 marks]

1. What is the main difference between exponential and logistic growth? [1 mark]
