# Tues Mar 21: Work on Lab 5/final project (catch-up day)

All students will receive full marks on this assignment. You do not need to hand anything in.

You should use the class time to work on Lab 5. If you have completed Lab 5, please work on your final project.

I will be in class and on Webex, if you would like to discuss anything.
