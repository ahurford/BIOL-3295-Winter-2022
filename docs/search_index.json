Please check my schedule and suggest a time I am free that works for you. 1.2 Course Information TR 12.00-12.50pm F 1-1.50pm When the university is online: See course Brightspace under Announcements for WebEx link. Lecture times are for help, lectures will not be recorded. When the university is in-person: SN3060. I will give a 20 minute lecture that will be recorded and uploaded to BrightSpace. R Lab 2-5pm When the university is online: See course Brightspace under Announcements for WebEx link. When the university is in-person: CSF 2218 (capacity is 9 computers provided) and 2342 (bring your own laptop). Course description: Population and Evolutionary Ecology is an introduction to the theory and principles of evolutionary ecology and population dynamics. Pre-requisites: BIOL 2600; at least one of BIOL 2010, 2122 or 2210. Course format: The course has been re-designed for online delivery. Specifically, no exams that require invigilation are part of the grading scheme because these are challenging to deliver remotely. Pre-recorded lectures limit my ability to interact with students. Therefore, I have elected to dedicate all lecture time to interacting with students. For each class there is a list of questions you are required to answer and hand-in. Prior to some classes there may be a Required Reading, that if completed will allow you to answer the day’s assignment questions. Prior to the day of class you should complete the Required Reading. In addition, I can most effectively help you if you have read over the questions ahead of time. When the university is remote (i.e. lectures are remote), labs will also be remote. Labs will be: January 20 February 3 February 17 March 3 March 17 March 31 Course will follow a similar format if the university returns to in-person lectures. If this is the case, I will give short lectures at the beginning of each class which cover the material in the assigned pre-lecture readings. Course expectations: Any students that are disruptive, violating university policies, or acting in a potentially unsafe way will be warned and asked to leave. Learning goals: I consider your completed assignments to be a portfolio of your knowledge in population and evolutionary ecology. You will also get some exposure to coding in R. It takes time to become proficient in a programming language, but the time you will spend coding in this class will help you towards becoming more proficient. The course content emphasizes a deeper understanding of fewer concepts. You have the opportunity to further explore a topic of interest to you for the final project. Required Text and Resources: The course materials are online at https://ahurford.github.io/BIOL-3295-Winter-2022/. In addition you will need a computer to install R and RStudio. This will be covered on Thursday January 20 in lab (see also here). Class announcements and WebEx links will be provided on the course BrightSpace and your assignments are to be submitted to BrightSpace. 1.3 Method of Evaluation 32 assignments, every lecture except the first (equal weighting) - 50% 6 labs (equal weighting) - 20% Takehome midterm (due Thursday March 3 at 9am) - 10% Final Project (due Wednesday April 20 at 9am) - 20% You should aim to complete each assignment before the next class, but assignments will be accepted, without penalty, up to a week later. You will have 2 weeks to complete the midterm. Late assignments, labs, and missed midterms, and final exams will be accommodated as described by University Regulation 6.7.3 and 6.7.5 (see https://www.mun.ca/regoff/calendar/sectionNo=REGS-0474 for Regulations). 1.4 Additional Policies 1.4.1 Accommodation of students with disabilities Memorial University of Newfoundland is committed to supporting inclusive education based on the principles of equity, accessibility and collaboration. Accommodations are provided within the scope of the University Policies for the Accommodations for Students with Disabilities see www.mun.ca/policy/site/policy.php?id=239. Students who may need an academic accommodation are asked to initiate the request with the Glenn Roy Blundon Centre at the earliest opportunity (see www.mun.ca/blundon for more information). 1.4.2 Academic misconduct Students are expected to adhere to those principles, which constitute proper academic conduct. A student has the responsibility to know which actions, as described under Academic Offences in the University Regulations, could be construed as dishonest or improper. Students found guilty of an academic offence may be subject to a number of penalties commensurate with the offence including reprimand, reduction of grade, probation, suspension or expulsion from the University. For more information regarding this policy, students should refer to University Regulation 6.12. 1.4.3 Equity and Diversity A safe learning environment will be provided for all students regardless of race, colour, nationality, ethnic origin, social origin, religious creed, religion, age, disability, disfigurement, sex (including pregnancy), sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, marital status, family status, source of income or political opinion. You should not photograph or record myself, teaching assistants, or other students in the class without first obtaining permission. Accommodation will be made for students with special needs. The sound should be turned off on phones and computers during class. 1.5 Additional Supports Resources for additional support can be found at: www.mun.ca/currentstudents/student/ https://munsu.ca/resource-centres/ 1.6 Tentative course schedule The course schedule is found in the toolbar of the class materials, see https://ahurford.github.io/BIOL-3295-Fall-2020/. The last day to drop the course without academic prejudice is Wednesday Nov. 4. 1.7 Handing in your work 1.7.1 Making figures to hand-in The graphs you hand in need to have descriptive axeses and a figure caption. You may put these elements together using a word processing software such as Microsoft Word. Elements of a good figure caption: Has a label, i.e., “Figure 1”, The first sentences provides a summary of what the figure shows, i.e., “The price of oranges has increased steadily since 1964”, Provide all necessary information to understand everything in the figure, i.e., if the figure has no legend, but multiple line types/symbols, be sure to indicate what is represented by the different symbols. If the axes labels are overly brief due to space constraints in the graph, provide a more thorough description in the figure caption. If any assumptions have been made in making the figure, disclose these, i.e., a point that was excluded from the analysis due to being considered an outlier. 1.7.2 Writing R scripts to hand-in To write your own R scripts follow the guidelines described in Chapter 7 Best Practices of Quantitative training in Biology. If you are asked to hand in your R script this means you need to submit an .R file on Brightspace.

Link Today’s questions help us work towards an application of discrete time exponential growth. Download the .pdf of the MSc thesis below and read the Abstract (the first two pages prior to the title page). Pay specific attention to the number of pheasants at different points in time, these might be \\(N_{t+1}\\) and \\(N_t\\) in the exponential growth formula; and the number of births and deaths that occur, these may help you estimate \\(\\lambda\\) in the exponential growth formula. Pay attention to the length of time that births and deaths are reported over, and what time of the year the population size is reported. Newcomb, HR. 1940. Ring-necked pheasant studies on Protection Island in the Strait of Juan de Fuca, Washington. MS thesis. Oregon State University. Noteably, Pheasant chicks are born during the summer. In May 1937, 10 pheasants were introduced to the island. Before the next breeding season there were 35. November 10, 1938 a census estimated 110 pheasants. October 13, 1939 a census estimated 400 pheasants. Between the 1938 and 1939 censuses, Newcomb observed that 17 adult birds died. During the 1938 nesting season there were 5.86 eggs/nest. 83.57% of eggs hatched. During the 1939 nesting season there were 8.73 eggs/nest. 64.58% hatched. During the 1939 nesting season: Average number of chicks per clutch was 6.93.\\(^1\\) You can assume the sex ratio is 50:50 male to female. Pheasants are a sexually reproducing species. \\(^1\\) Note that g. and h. appear to be contradictory. 4.2 Questions When considering an application to determine the correct values of \\(\\lambda\\) and \\(N_t\\) in the exponential growth formula, it helps to understand that for all mathematical formulas there must be the same units on both sides of the equals sign, and for each term that is added or subtracted. The units of the population size, \\(N_t\\), at time, \\(t\\), are number. The geometric growth rate, \\(\\lambda\\) is unitless. Choose an equation from Vandermeer and Gordon 2013 p1-3 and give the units for each of the terms to show that both sides of the equals have the same units. For example, for the equation from the last assignment: \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} N_t &amp; = &amp; N_0 \\lambda^t \\\\ \\left(\\mbox{number}\\right)&amp; =&amp;(\\mbox{number}) (\\mbox{unitless})^{weeks}\\\\ \\left(\\mbox{number}\\right)&amp; =&amp; \\left(\\mbox{number}\\right)\\\\ \\end{eqnarray*}\\] Note that: \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} &amp; \\bullet &amp; (\\mbox{unitless}) \\times (\\mbox{quantity with units}) = (\\mbox{quantity with units}) \\\\ &amp; \\bullet &amp; (\\mbox{unitless})^{(\\mbox{quantity})} = (\\mbox{unitless}) \\end{eqnarray*}\\] [2 marks] Although not stated in the Vandermeer and Gordon (2013) p1-3 reading, \\(\\lambda = 1 + b - d\\) where \\(b\\) is the per capita birth rate over one time step (i.e. one week for the lilipad example, or 1 year for the pheasant example), and \\(d\\) is the fraction of the population that dies over one time step. The number 1 is considered unitless. What must the units of \\(b\\) and \\(d\\) be? [1 mark] In the Vandermeer and Gordon (2013) p1-3 reading, \\(\\lambda = 2\\). Given that \\(\\lambda = 1 + b - d\\), what are some possible values of \\(b\\) and \\(d\\). Note that \\(d\\) is a fraction and must be \\(1 \\geq d \\geq 0\\) and \\(b&gt;0\\). [1 mark] Let \\(d\\) be the fraction of the population that dies each year. By considering a. to i. above, estimate \\(d\\) for the ring-tailed pheasant population on Protection Island. Remember \\(d\\) must be a fraction: you need to divide by the number of pheasants that could have died during the time period under consideration. Write down any assumptions you have made. For example, did you assume that the mortality rate for one year is then the same for other years?

The population is growing if after one time unit, there are more individuals than there are at time \\(t\\), i.e., \\(N_{t+1}&gt;N_t\\). For what values of \\(\\lambda\\) will the population grow? [Hint: If you find this question difficult, substitute some numbers to help you find the answer. Let \\(N_t=1\\) and then try some values of \\(\\lambda &gt; 0\\). Since you let, \\(N_t = 1\\), the population is growing if \\(N_{t+1}&gt;1\\).

The estimation of \\(b\\) for an exponential growth model is more subtle. First, \\(b\\) it is estimated as the number of births (occurring between \\(t\\) and \\(t+1\\)), divided by the number of individuals that could have given birth, \\(N_t\\). You might average this value across multiple years if sufficient data are available. Furthermore, to correctly project the future population size, we should understand that \\(b\\) is more than the number of individuals born, additionally these individuals must survive to the next time step. Given a.-i. estimate \\(b\\). Write down any assumptions you have made. [3 marks] Recall that \\(\\lambda = 1 + b-d\\).

Population Ecology: First Principles (Second Edition). Princeton University Press, Princeton, United States. p4-8. Link We now have two ways of describing how population size changes with time whereby each individual has the same average number of offspring per unit time and the same probability of dying. Discrete time geometric growth: \\[\\begin{equation} N_t = N_0\\lambda^t \\tag{7.1} \\end{equation}\\] and, Continuous time exponential growth: \\[\\begin{equation} N(t) = N(0)e^{rt} \\tag{7.2} \\end{equation}\\] Notably, for both these models the per capita birth and death rates do not change change over time, and do not change with density or age. The notation \\(N_t\\) and \\(N(t)\\) is conventional for discrete time versus continuous time formulations respectively, however, these notations both mean the same: the population size at a particular time, \\(t\\). When \\(t=0\\) we have the population size at time 0: \\(N_0\\) or \\(N(0)\\). As noted in the reading, when \\(\\lambda = e^{r}\\) the equations are the same. Note that \\(e\\) is the exponential function, exp() or \\(e^x\\). 7.2 Discrete or continuous time formulations Whether it is appropriate to model a population in a discrete time or continous time formulation depends on whether births and deaths are overlapping or neatly partitioned into a distinct time period. For example, for many animals there is a distinct breeding season: a short proportion of the year when offspring are born. As such, there is very little temporal overlap between the times of year when births and deaths occur. Humans are an example of a species that might reasonably be modelled as continuous time because babies are born year round. 7.3 Questions For what values of \\(r\\) does the population size increase over time? Note that \\(r\\) might be negative, and I am asking not if the population size, \\(N(t)\\) is positive, but if the population is increasing, i.e., if \\(N(t)\\) is getting larger in value over time. [1 mark] As described in the reading, \\(b\\) is a per capita birth rate, and \\(d\\) is a per capita death rate, and \\(r = b-d\\). For continuous time exponential growth, both \\(b\\) and \\(d\\) must be non-negative and can take any values bigger than 0. Note that this differs from the discrete time model formulation where \\(0 \\leq d \\leq 1\\). When \\(d &gt; 1\\) in the continuous time formulation, this means that the average lifespan is less than one time step (i.e., the average life span is \\(1/d\\)). For example, when \\(d = 2\\) this means that the average life expectancy for an individual is 1/2 a time step (i.e., days or year, however, the time unit is defined in the model). When the population size increases over time, what is true of \\(b\\) relative to \\(d\\)? [1 mark] For what value of \\(r\\) does \\(N(t)\\) not change over time? Hint: if \\(N(t)\\) is not changing then \\(N(t)=N(0)\\) for all \\(t\\). [1 mark] Consider the equation: \\[ \\frac{dN(t)}{dt} = rN(t). \\] As described in the reading, this is an alternative way to write the continuous time exponential growth equation. The quantity \\(\\frac{dN(t)}{dt}\\) can be understood as the slope of a graph where population size is on the vertical axis and time is on the horizontal axis. As such, if the slope is zero, \\(\\frac{dN(t)}{dt}=0\\), then the population size is not changing. If \\(\\frac{dN(t)}{dt}&lt;0\\), then the population size is decreasing. For what value of \\(r\\) does the population size decrease? What is true about \\(b\\) relative to \\(d\\) in this instance?

The goal of Lab 2 is to understand exponential growth and logistic growth in more depth and to solve ordinary differential equations using a computer. 13.1 Change in population size, and population size Recall that for continuous time exponential growth there were two ways that the equation might be written. Firstly, as a change in population size over time, \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{dN(t)}{dt} = rN(t), \\tag{13.1} \\end{equation}\\] such that if \\(\\frac{dN(t)}{dt}&gt;0\\), the population size, \\(N(t)\\) is increasing over time, and if \\(\\frac{dN(t)}{dt}&lt;0\\), the population size is decreasing over time. Alternatively, we can write continuous time exponential growth as, \\[\\begin{equation} N(t) = N(0)e^{rt}, \\tag{13.2} \\end{equation}\\] where the lefthand side of equation (13.2) states the size of the population, \\(N(t)\\), at time \\(t\\), rather than the change in the size of the population, as it did in equation (13.1). For logistic growth, we have: \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{dN(t)}{dt} = rN(t)\\left(1 - \\frac{N(t)}{K} \\right). \\tag{13.3} \\end{equation}\\] How might we find the equivalent of equation (13.2) for logistic growth? i.e., for logistic growth, what is the equation for the size of the population at a particular time, \\(t\\)? If you are great at math, you might integrate equation (13.3) using separation of variables. However, another option is to numerically integrate equation (13.3) using a computer. 13.2 What is an ordinary differential equation? In an introductory calculus course that covers integration, most often you are solving problems of the type: \\[\\begin{eqnarray} \\frac{dy(x)}{dx} &amp;=&amp; x^2, \\\\ \\int \\frac{dy(x)}{dx} &amp;=&amp; \\int x^2 \\ dx, \\\\ y(x) &amp;=&amp; \\frac{1}{3}x^3 + c. \\tag{13.4} \\end{eqnarray}\\] Note that in the above calculations, we are able to use integration to find \\(y(x)\\) when we are given the rate of change equation, \\(\\frac{dy(x)}{dx}\\). In the above equations: \\(x\\) is the independent variable, and \\(y(x)\\) is the dependent variable. The derivative of \\(y(x)\\) is with respect to \\(x\\), and \\(x\\) appears on the opposite side of the = to the derivative of the dependent variable. In the notation of population biology, where \\(N(t)\\) is conventional for the dependent variable, a similar problem might look like this: \\[\\begin{eqnarray} \\int \\frac{dN(t)}{dt} &amp;=&amp; \\int rt \\ dt, \\\\ \\nonumber N(t) &amp;=&amp; \\frac{1}{2}rt^2 + c. \\tag{13.5} \\end{eqnarray}\\] We have not seen any equations like equation (13.5) in BIOL 3295 so far: usually, our equations for the change in the population size, \\(\\frac{dN(t)}{dt}\\), have a dependency on the population size, \\(N(t)\\) (the dependent variable), rather than a sole dependency on \\(t\\) (the independent variable). The equations that are models for population biology are sometimes ODEs. While some ODEs can be solved using math, commonly the ODEs that are used to model population dynamics need to be integrated numerically; that is, using a computer. 13.3 Numerically integrating an ordinary differential equation in R Numerical integration in R can be performed by installing this package: install.packages(&quot;deSolve&quot;) Alternatively, you might install the package using the Packages tab. To integrate our ODE, we use the function ode() from the deSolve package. Let’s look at the structure of this function. The mandatory arguments to the function are: ode(y,times,parms,func) where, y is a vector of the initial values of the dependent variable (i.e., those which correspond to the initial time). times is a sequence of time points that we will calculate the values of the variables; the first value of times is the initial time. func is a function that computes the values of the derivatives of the dependent variables. func must be defined as: func &lt;- function(t, y, parms,...). t is the current time point in the integration, and y is the current estimate of the variables in the ODE system. Given what we have learned in BIOL 3295 so far, y and times are not so tricky, but the func argument requires us to write our own function, and so far we have only used functions written by other people (i.e., the plot() function): we have yet to write our own custom functions. In preparation for numerically integrating the logistic growth equation, we will now learn how to write custom functions. 13.4 Writing custom functions Generally, your code can still work without writing custom functions, however writing functions makes your code modular and more organized. Consider the following code: # Temperatures in Celcius temp.min.C &lt;- 10 temp.max.C &lt;- 20 # Temperatures in Farenheit temp.min.F &lt;- temp.min.C*9/5+32 temp.max.F &lt;- temp.max.C*9/5+32 The above code is fine, but since the same calculation is performed twice (conversion of Celcius to Farenheit), just with a different number, we might consider writing a custom function. Let’s re-write the above code so that it now uses a custom function: # A function that converts Celcius to Farenheit C.to.F &lt;- function(C){ F &lt;- C*9/5 +32 return(F) } # Temperatures in Celcius temp.min.C &lt;- 10 temp.max.C &lt;- 20 # Temperatures in Farenheit temp.min.F &lt;- C.to.F(temp.min.C) temp.max.F &lt;- C.to.F(temp.max.C) Note that the above code consists of the function definition and the function call. The function definition uses the function function(). In the example, note the following: arglist is just one value: C. Generally, several values might be provided to the function where each should be separated by commas and enclosed within the (). expression can be any set of commands and should be enclosed within the {}. The function is assigned a name: C.to.F. We give the function a name so that we can use it later during a function call. 13.5 Questions The following is an equation for exponential population growth with a constant immigration rate, \\(m&gt;0\\), into the population: \\[ \\frac{dN(t)}{dt}= rN(t) + m \\] where \\(r\\) is the net reproductive rate, and \\(N(t)\\) is the population size at time, \\(t\\). Is this equation an ordinary differential equation (ODE)? Give 1 sentence explaining your reasoning [2 marks]. Write a function that adds 123 to a user supplied argument, and then write the line of code that calls the function to evaluate 123+1, and assigns the result the variable name y. You are to hand in your R script. [5 marks] 13.6 Writing the func argument for ode() The func argument of ode() has the following constraints: The arglist must include t, y, and parms. The value returned must be a list of the rates of change in the dependent variable(s). Note that if your ODE comprises of more than one variable that is changing over time, then y will be a vector (this means it is a list of numbers). Below is an example of how func might be coded for exponential growth. Remember that the ODE for exponential growth is: \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{dN(t)}{dt} = rN(t) \\tag{13.6} \\end{equation}\\] Below equation (13.6) is coded in the appropriate syntax for eventual use in the ode() function: # Write a function that returns a list of the rate of change in your dependent variables. model = function(t,y,parms){ # It&#39;s a personal perference of mine to switch the symbols # to be consistent with the equation. N &lt;- y[1] # This is this equation for dN/dt dN &lt;- r*N # The function returns the value of the change in N. return(list(c(dN))) } Let’s try out the function to make sure it works. Copy and paste the function into your Console and then type: r&lt;-1 model(1,2,parms=NULL) Did you get 2? Does it make sense to you that the returned value is 2? Try some other values. Are the values making sense? Now that the func argument of ode() has been demonstrated, the remaining arguments for the ode() function are not so bad. # The initial value of N yini&lt;- c(N = 1) # the times for the numerical integration times &lt;- seq(0, 1, by = .1) Remember to assign a value for r: # Asign a value to the parameter: r &lt;- 2 And then once all the arguments are set, call the function, and plot the results: # performing the numerical integration out &lt;- ode(y = yini, parms = NULL, times = times, func = model) out &lt;- data.frame(out) head(out) # this line overrides a multipanel plot. I had tried plot(out) # and was having conflicts with a small plotting window on my # laptop. Generally, the below line isn&#39;t necessary. par(mfrow=c(1,1)) # Make the graph plot(out$time, out$N, typ = &quot;l&quot;) 13.7 Questions For the code model(1,2,parms=NULL) (where the function model is defined above), what do 1 and 2 correspond to? One of these quantities does not affect the value that the model() function returns. Which quantity does not affect the value the function returns? [2 marks] Write an R Script that numerically integrates the logistic growth function (equation (13.3)). Choose a value of \\(r\\) such that the population size increases over time. Remember to use good practices for writing your script - see 1.7.2. Your script should produce a graph with \\(N(t)\\) on the y-axis and time on the x-axis [10 marks] Add to your script from 4. such that another graph is produced, this time where the population size decreases over time. Note that this should just require adding new lines to the bottom of your question 1 script such that you: a) set a new value of r; b) run the ode() command; and c) make the graph. In other words, it is not necessary to define the logistic growth function, model, again because that has not changed. Further, if you are happy to use the same values of times as for question 1, you do not need to restate this either. Answer this question by adding a few lines of code to your answer to 1. You are to hand in your R script. You should answer both questions 4. and 5. in the same R script. [5 marks] An ordinary differential equation for logistic growth (continuous time) with immigration and emigration is: \\[\\frac{dN(t)}{dt} = rN(t)\\left(1-\\frac{N(t)}{K}\\right) + m_1 - m_2N(t) \\] where \\(N(t) \\geq 0\\) is the population size (units: number), \\(K&gt;0\\) is the carrying capacity (units: number), \\(r\\) is the net reproductive rate (units: 1/time), \\(m_1&gt;0\\) is the immigration rate (units: number/time), and \\(m_2&gt;0\\) is the emigration rate (units: 1/time). You are to numerically integrate this equation and make a graph for \\(N(t)\\) (y-axis) versus time, \\(t\\) (x-axis). You are free to choose the parameter values for \\(r, K, m_1\\) and \\(m_2\\), the initial value of \\(N(0)\\), and the times over which you integrate. Add your code that solves this question to your R Script answering 4. and 5.

Let’s consider an age-structured population where: Individuals aged less than 1 year old do not reproduce, and will survive to 1 year old with a probability of 0.5. Individuals aged less than 2 years old have 2 offspring and then die.

Note that in the system of equations (14.1), some of the values that were zeros were omitted, i.e., \\[\\begin{eqnarray} N_{1,t+1} &amp; = &amp; 0 N_{1,t} + 2 N_{2,t}, \\nonumber \\\\ N_{2,t+1} &amp; = &amp; 0.5 N_{1,t} + 0 N_{2,t}, \\tag{14.2} \\end{eqnarray}\\] Note that as written above, consistency with the ordering is necessary: \\(N_{1,t+1}\\) appears above \\(N_{2,t+1}\\), and on the other side of the = \\(N_{1,t}\\) always appears to the left of \\(N_{2,t}\\). When written as the system of equations (14.2), we can now more easily write the system of equations (14.1) in matrix notation: \\[\\begin{equation} \\left[ \\begin{array}{c} N_{1,t+1}\\\\ N_{2,t+1}\\\\ \\end{array} \\right] = \\left[ \\begin{array}{cc} 0 &amp; 2\\\\ 0.5 &amp; 0\\\\ \\end{array} \\right] \\left[ \\begin{array}{c} N_{1,t}\\\\ N_{2,t}\\\\ \\end{array} \\right] \\tag{14.3} \\end{equation}\\] Again, let \\(N_{1,0} = 10\\) and \\(N_{2,0} = 5\\). Using the system of equations (14.3), and remembering how to multiply a matrix by a column vector, what is \\(N_{1,1}\\) and \\(N_{2,1}\\)? Did you get the same answer (but now formatted as a vector) as you did to this same question, but when the problem wasn’t in matrix notation (i.e., equation (14.1))? Yes? Super! Now, we have two equivalent ways to write our population models with age structure. This may seem unhelpful now, but remember that later matrix notation will be helpful to calculate the rate of population increase and the ratio of individuals in the age or stage classes. 14.2 Questions Consider an age-structured population where: Individuals aged less than 1 year old do not reproduce, and will survive to 1 year old with a probability of 0.2.

Population Ecology: First Principles (Second Edition). Princeton University Press, Princeton, United States. p37-39. Link Today we will learn how to determine if a population with age- or stage-structure is expected to increase or decrease over time. Recall, that for discrete time, without age- or stage-structure, and for exponential (also called geometric) growth we had: \\[N_{t+1} = \\lambda N_t,\\] where the population size, \\(N_t\\), increases over time if \\(\\lambda &gt; 1\\). For age- and stage-structured populations, rather than a scalar, \\(\\lambda\\), (i.e. just one number) we have a matrix, \\(\\mathbb{P}\\), containing many numbers: \\[\\begin{equation} \\mathbb{P} = \\left[ \\begin{array}{ccccc} p_{11} &amp; p_{12} &amp; \\dots &amp; \\dots &amp; p_{1n} \\\\ p_{21} &amp; p_{22} &amp; \\dots &amp; \\dots &amp; p_{2n} \\\\ \\vdots &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\vdots \\\\ p_{n1} &amp; \\dots &amp; \\dots &amp; \\dots &amp; p_{nn} \\\\ \\end{array} \\right], \\end{equation}\\] where each number represents the contribution that one of the age- or stage-classes makes to another. Recall that to calculate the population size at the next time step, we use matrix multiplication: \\[\\begin{eqnarray} \\left[ \\begin{array}{c} N_{1,t+1} \\\\ N_{2,t+1}\\\\ \\vdots \\\\ N_{n,t+1} \\end{array} \\right] = \\left[ \\begin{array}{ccccc} p_{11} &amp; p_{12} &amp; \\dots &amp; \\dots &amp; p_{1n} \\\\ p_{21} &amp; p_{22} &amp; \\dots &amp; \\dots &amp; p_{2n} \\\\ \\vdots &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\vdots \\\\ p_{n1} &amp; \\dots &amp; \\dots &amp; \\dots &amp; p_{nn} \\\\ \\end{array} \\right] \\left[ \\begin{array}{c} N_{1,t} \\\\ N_{2,t} \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ N_{n,t} \\end{array} \\right] , \\end{eqnarray}\\] Let us ask: is there a scalar (a single number), \\(\\lambda\\), that we could multiply the population sizes in each of the age or stage classes at time, \\(t\\), by, such that the effect would be the same as doing the matrix multiplication, i.e., is there a \\(\\lambda\\), such that, \\[\\begin{eqnarray} \\left[ \\begin{array}{c} N_{1,t+1} \\\\ N_{2,t+1}\\\\ \\vdots \\\\ N_{n,t+1} \\end{array} \\right] = \\lambda \\left[ \\begin{array}{c} N_{1,t} \\\\ N_{2,t} \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ N_{n,t} \\end{array} \\right] , \\end{eqnarray}\\] and \\(\\lambda\\) can be substituted for the matrix \\(\\mathbb{P}\\), and the population sizes in each age and stage in the future are projected to be the same? The answer to this question, in general, is ‘no’ because the different stage classes increase by different amounts. However, for special values of the population sizes in each stage class at time, \\(t\\), the equivalence relationship between the scalar \\(\\lambda\\), and matrix \\(\\mathbb{P}\\), does hold. These special values are called the stable stage structure (or stable age structure if the population is grouped by age). When the stable stage structure is reached, all stages increase by the same factor, \\(\\lambda\\), each time step, such that: \\[\\begin{eqnarray} \\lambda \\left[ \\begin{array}{c} \\hat{N}_{1,t} \\\\ \\hat{N}_{2,t} \\\\ \\end{array} \\right] = \\left[ \\begin{array}{cc} a_{11} &amp; a_{12} \\\\ a_{21} &amp; a_{22} \\\\ \\end{array} \\right] \\left[ \\begin{array}{c} \\hat{N}_{1,t} \\\\ \\hat{N}_{2,t} \\\\ \\end{array} \\right] , \\end{eqnarray}\\] where the hat notation, \\([\\hat{N}_{1,t}, \\hat{N}_{2,t}]^T\\), is to indicate that the population sizes for each of the stages are that of the stable stage structure. The matrix elements have been written as \\(a_{ij}\\) because as we continue with this example, we will consider two stages, rather then \\(n\\) (as in the matrix \\(\\mathbb{P}\\)), to make the calculation simpler. For a 2 \\(\\times\\) 2 matrix (i.e., two stages in a stage structured population), \\(\\lambda\\) is calculated as, \\[\\begin{equation} Det \\left[ \\begin{array}{cc} a_{11}-\\lambda &amp; a_{12} \\\\ a_{21} &amp; a_{22}-\\lambda \\\\ \\end{array} \\right] = 0 \\end{equation}\\] which in math is called the determinant of \\(\\mathbb{A} - \\lambda \\mathbb{I}\\). The determinant for the 2 \\(\\times\\) 2 matrix is calculated as follows: \\[\\begin{eqnarray} (a_{11} - \\lambda)(a_{22} - \\lambda) - a_{12}a_{21} &amp; = &amp; 0 \\\\ \\lambda^2 - (a_{11} + a_{22})\\lambda + a_{11}a_{22} - a_{12}a_{21} &amp; = &amp; 0 \\end{eqnarray}\\] We can solve this equation using the quadratic formula: \\[\\lambda = \\frac{a_{11} + a_{22} \\pm \\sqrt{(a_{11}+a_{22})^2 - 4(a_{11}a_{22} - a_{21}a_{12})}}{2}. \\] This gives two solutions. The dominant eigenvalue is the solution for \\(\\lambda\\) that has largest absolute value. If the absolute value of the dominant eigenvalue is greater than 1, the population will increase. If the absolute value of the dominant eigenvalue is less than 1, the population will decrease. 16.2 Questions The Leslie matrix for a frog population is: \\[\\begin{equation} \\left[ \\begin{array}{cc} 0 &amp; 2\\\\ 0.5 &amp; 0.2\\\\ \\end{array} \\right] \\end{equation}\\] Let 0.5 be the fraction of young-of-the-year frogs that survive to be more than 1 year old.

Details of what the report should include can be found at the end of these instructions. Open R Studio and Install the package popbio. Download and run the file Lab 3.R (found on BrightSpace). This code will produce 2 graphs: 1) the number of seeds over time, and 2) the number of the different types of plants over time. Into the R console type: head(aq.trans) This command lists the first six data entries. To understand the meaning of the columns in the dataframe, click the Packages tab, click popbio and then scroll down to aq.trans and click on that. Does the dataset contain any information on the number of seeds produced each year? To determine how many different plots are recorded in this dataset, into the R console type: table(aq.trans$plot) Modify this command to generate summary statistics for other variables that you are interested in. The code uses a subset of the data: only year 1998 and plot 909. To see the data subset, type: sf into the R console. Does every flowering plant produce fruit? The dataset does not contain any information on the number of seeds. In the code, what assumptions are made to estimate the size of the seed bank in 1999? Type, A into the R console. This is the projection matrix. Where i is an index for the row number (top to bottom) and j is an index for the column (left to right), the elements of the projection matrix are the number of i that will be produced by each j over the course of a year. Try it out – the number of seeds produced per seed is 0.4. This means that each seed has a 0.4 probability of surviving a year. How many small plants is each small plant expected to produce? How many large? How many with flowers? If a small plant, next year, can only be a small plant, a large plant a flowering plant, or dead, what must be the probability that the small plant dies? What is the probability a large plant dies? A flower? Type nt into the R console. The intrinsic rate of growth of the population is the dominant eigenvalue of the projection matrix, A. If the dominant eigenvalue is bigger than 1, the population will grow. If the dominant eigenvalue is less than 1, the population will eventually go extinct. The dominant eigenvalue of our projection matrix, A, is calculated as, nt$lambda. Will the population of yellow columbines in plot 909 grow? Type the command, nt=pop.projection(A,n,20) into the R console. This command starts with an initial population size of n and uses the projection matrix A, to calculate the size of the population for the next 19 years. Note that in the code n = c(10000, 100, 100, 100, 100) means that we start with 10,000 seeds and 100 of each type of plant. The predicted number of yellow columbine in each stage each year is nt$stage.vectors. After 19 years, which stages have increased in prevalence? Consult the graphs (be sure to figure out which lines correspond to which stages – you will need to consult the R code). Does it look like the population will persist? Increase the number of years that you predict the size of the population for. Were you correct that the population will go extinct? For this model, eventually the fraction of the population that is in each stage will be unchanging. The relative abundance of each stage (providing that sufficient time has passed) is predicted by the right eigenvalue of the projection matrix, A. Type stable.stage(A) into the R console. Reset the number of years into the future that you predict the population abundance to 19 (i.e., the command from 8.) and re-run Lab6.R (using the Source button). Now, we wish to test whether the predicted relative of abundance of each stage is achieved on the 19th year into the future. Type, nt$stage.vectors[,19]/sum(nt$stage.vectors[,19]). The stable stage distribution is dominated by the abundance of seeds. To calculate the relative abundance of just the plant stages type nt$stage.vectors[2:5,19]/sum(nt$stage.vectors[2:5,19]) About what percentage of plants would we expect to be flowering? If the population does not start at the stable stage distribution it may take some time to reach the stable distribution. Is the stable stage distribution reached on the 5th year? Modify the commands form above to determine this. Suppose it were possible to increase any non-zero entry of the projection matrix by a fixed amount. Increasing the value of which entry by a fixed amount would have the biggest affect the intrinsic growth rate, lambda? To answer this question type, sensitivity(A, zero=TRUE) The results of this command tells us that increasing the fraction of seeds that germinate each year would most substantially increase the intrinsic growth rate. How this information help us to figure out how best to promote the growth of yellow columbine? Currently, the population of yellow columbines is destined to go extinct. Change the value of seed.survival until the population is just able to persist. What is this value? Write a report describing the results of your analysis of the yellow columbine population. Your report should include the following: • In the Introduction section, write one sentence (with a citation) describing yellow columbine (Aquilegia chrysantha). The citation may be from the Internet or from the peer-reviewed literature. • In the Data section, describe the data that was used to parameterize the projection matrix. Be sure to mention that only a subset of the data was used in the analysis.

Write out the projection matrix and explain what the elements of the projection matrix mean. What is the stable stage distribution? What does it mean? Include a graph of the population dynamics of the different plant stages of yellow columbine. In the figure caption, make sure you mention what each of the different line types represents. • In the Discussion section, you should address the following questions: How might your conclusions change if your assumptions were different?
