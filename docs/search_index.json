The deadline to submit your answers is Tues Feb 1. 4.1 Required reading If you have not done so already, please read: Vandermeer, J.H., Goldberg, D.E., 2013. Population Ecology: First Principles (Second Edition). Princeton University Press, Princeton, United States. p1-3. Link Todayâ€™s questions help us work towards an application of discrete time exponential growth. Download the .pdf of the MSc thesis below and read the Abstract (the first two pages prior to the title page). Pay specific attention to the number of pheasants at different points in time, these might be \\(N_{t+1}\\) and \\(N_t\\) in the exponential growth formula; and the number of births and deaths that occur, these may help you estimate \\(\\lambda\\) in the exponential growth formula. Pay attention to the length of time that births and deaths are reported over, and what time of the year the population size is reported. Newcomb, HR. 1940. Ring-necked pheasant studies on Protection Island in the Strait of Juan de Fuca, Washington. MS thesis. Oregon State University. Noteably, Pheasant chicks are born during the summer. In May 1937, 10 pheasants were introduced to the island. Before the next breeding season there were 35. November 10, 1938 a census estimated 110 pheasants. October 13, 1939 a census estimated 400 pheasants. Between the 1938 and 1939 censuses, Newcomb observed that 17 adult birds died. During the 1938 nesting season there were 5.86 eggs/nest. 83.57% of eggs hatched. During the 1939 nesting season there were 8.73 eggs/nest. 64.58% hatched. During the 1939 nesting season: Average number of chicks per clutch was 6.93.\\(^1\\) You can assume the sex ratio is 50:50 male to female. Pheasants are a sexually reproducing species. \\(^1\\) Note that g. and h. appear to be contradictory. 4.2 Questions When considering an application to determine the correct values of \\(\\lambda\\) and \\(N_t\\) in the exponential growth formula, it helps to understand that for all mathematical formulas there must be the same units on both sides of the equals sign, and for each term that is added or subtracted. The units of the population size, \\(N_t\\), at time, \\(t\\), are number. The geometric growth rate, \\(\\lambda\\) is unitless. Choose an equation from Vandermeer and Gordon 2013 p1-3 and give the units for each of the terms to show that both sides of the equals have the same units. For example, for the equation from the last assignment: \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} N_t &amp; = &amp; N_0 \\lambda^t \\\\ \\left(\\mbox{number}\\right)&amp; =&amp;(\\mbox{number}) (\\mbox{unitless})^{weeks}\\\\ \\left(\\mbox{number}\\right)&amp; =&amp; \\left(\\mbox{number}\\right)\\\\ \\end{eqnarray*}\\] Note that: \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} &amp; \\bullet &amp; (\\mbox{unitless}) \\times (\\mbox{quantity with units}) = (\\mbox{quantity with units}) \\\\ &amp; \\bullet &amp; (\\mbox{unitless})^{(\\mbox{quantity})} = (\\mbox{unitless}) \\end{eqnarray*}\\] [2 marks] Although not stated in the Vandermeer and Gordon (2013) p1-3 reading, \\(\\lambda = 1 + b - d\\) where \\(b\\) is the per capita birth rate over one time step (i.e. one week for the lilipad example, or 1 year for the pheasant example), and \\(d\\) is the fraction of the population that dies over one time step. The number 1 is considered unitless. What must the units of \\(b\\) and \\(d\\) be? [1 mark] In the Vandermeer and Gordon (2013) p1-3 reading, \\(\\lambda = 2\\). Given that \\(\\lambda = 1 + b - d\\), what are some possible values of \\(b\\) and \\(d\\). Note that \\(d\\) is a fraction and must be \\(1 \\geq d \\geq 0\\) and \\(b&gt;0\\). [1 mark] Let \\(d\\) be the fraction of the population that dies each year. By considering a. to i. above, estimate \\(d\\) for the ring-tailed pheasant population on Protection Island. Remember \\(d\\) must be a fraction: you need to divide by the number of pheasants that could have died during the time period under consideration. Write down any assumptions you have made. For example, did you assume that the mortality rate for one year is then the same for other years? [3 marks] "]]
