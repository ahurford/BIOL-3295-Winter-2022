Please check my schedule and suggest a time I am free that works for you. 1.2 Course Information TR 12.00-12.50pm F 1-1.50pm When the university is online: See course Brightspace under Announcements for WebEx link. Lecture times are for help, lectures will not be recorded. When the university is in-person: SN3060. I will give a 20 minute lecture that will be recorded and uploaded to BrightSpace. R Lab 2-5pm When the university is online: See course Brightspace under Announcements for WebEx link. When the university is in-person: CSF 2218 (capacity is 9 computers provided) and 2342 (bring your own laptop). Course description: Population and Evolutionary Ecology is an introduction to the theory and principles of evolutionary ecology and population dynamics. Pre-requisites: BIOL 2600; at least one of BIOL 2010, 2122 or 2210. Course format: The course has been re-designed for online delivery. Specifically, no exams that require invigilation are part of the grading scheme because these are challenging to deliver remotely. Pre-recorded lectures limit my ability to interact with students. Therefore, I have elected to dedicate all lecture time to interacting with students. For each class there is a list of questions you are required to answer and hand-in. Prior to some classes there may be a Required Reading, that if completed will allow you to answer the day’s assignment questions. Prior to the day of class you should complete the Required Reading. In addition, I can most effectively help you if you have read over the questions ahead of time. When the university is remote (i.e. lectures are remote), labs will also be remote. Labs will be: January 20 February 3 February 17 March 3 March 17 March 31 Course will follow a similar format if the university returns to in-person lectures. If this is the case, I will give short lectures at the beginning of each class which cover the material in the assigned pre-lecture readings. Course expectations: Any students that are disruptive, violating university policies, or acting in a potentially unsafe way will be warned and asked to leave. Learning goals: I consider your completed assignments to be a portfolio of your knowledge in population and evolutionary ecology. You will also get some exposure to coding in R. It takes time to become proficient in a programming language, but the time you will spend coding in this class will help you towards becoming more proficient. The course content emphasizes a deeper understanding of fewer concepts. You have the opportunity to further explore a topic of interest to you for the final project. Required Text and Resources: The course materials are online at https://ahurford.github.io/BIOL-3295-Winter-2022/. In addition you will need a computer to install R and RStudio. This will be covered on Thursday January 20 in lab (see also here). Class announcements and WebEx links will be provided on the course BrightSpace and your assignments are to be submitted to BrightSpace. 1.3 Method of Evaluation 32 assignments, every lecture except the first (equal weighting) - 50% 6 labs (equal weighting) - 20% Takehome midterm (due Thursday March 3 at 9am) - 10% Final Project (due Wednesday April 20 at 9am) - 20% You should aim to complete each assignment before the next class, but assignments will be accepted, without penalty, up to a week later. You will have 2 weeks to complete the midterm. Late assignments, labs, and missed midterms, and final exams will be accommodated as described by University Regulation 6.7.3 and 6.7.5 (see https://www.mun.ca/regoff/calendar/sectionNo=REGS-0474 for Regulations). 1.4 Additional Policies 1.4.1 Accommodation of students with disabilities Memorial University of Newfoundland is committed to supporting inclusive education based on the principles of equity, accessibility and collaboration. Accommodations are provided within the scope of the University Policies for the Accommodations for Students with Disabilities see www.mun.ca/policy/site/policy.php?id=239. Students who may need an academic accommodation are asked to initiate the request with the Glenn Roy Blundon Centre at the earliest opportunity (see www.mun.ca/blundon for more information). 1.4.2 Academic misconduct Students are expected to adhere to those principles, which constitute proper academic conduct. A student has the responsibility to know which actions, as described under Academic Offences in the University Regulations, could be construed as dishonest or improper. Students found guilty of an academic offence may be subject to a number of penalties commensurate with the offence including reprimand, reduction of grade, probation, suspension or expulsion from the University. For more information regarding this policy, students should refer to University Regulation 6.12. 1.4.3 Equity and Diversity A safe learning environment will be provided for all students regardless of race, colour, nationality, ethnic origin, social origin, religious creed, religion, age, disability, disfigurement, sex (including pregnancy), sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, marital status, family status, source of income or political opinion. You should not photograph or record myself, teaching assistants, or other students in the class without first obtaining permission. Accommodation will be made for students with special needs. The sound should be turned off on phones and computers during class. 1.5 Additional Supports Resources for additional support can be found at: www.mun.ca/currentstudents/student/ https://munsu.ca/resource-centres/ 1.6 Tentative course schedule The course schedule is found in the toolbar of the class materials, see https://ahurford.github.io/BIOL-3295-Fall-2020/. The last day to drop the course without academic prejudice is Wednesday Nov. 4. 1.7 Handing in your work 1.7.1 Making figures to hand-in The graphs you hand in need to have descriptive axeses and a figure caption. You may put these elements together using a word processing software such as Microsoft Word. Elements of a good figure caption: Has a label, i.e., “Figure 1”, The first sentences provides a summary of what the figure shows, i.e., “The price of oranges has increased steadily since 1964”, Provide all necessary information to understand everything in the figure, i.e., if the figure has no legend, but multiple line types/symbols, be sure to indicate what is represented by the different symbols. If the axes labels are overly brief due to space constraints in the graph, provide a more thorough description in the figure caption. If any assumptions have been made in making the figure, disclose these, i.e., a point that was excluded from the analysis due to being considered an outlier. 1.7.2 Writing R scripts to hand-in To write your own R scripts follow the guidelines described in Chapter 7 Best Practices of Quantitative training in Biology. If you are asked to hand in your R script this means you need to submit an .R file on Brightspace.

Link Today’s questions help us work towards an application of discrete time exponential growth. Download the .pdf of the MSc thesis below and read the Abstract (the first two pages prior to the title page). Pay specific attention to the number of pheasants at different points in time, these might be \\(N_{t+1}\\) and \\(N_t\\) in the exponential growth formula; and the number of births and deaths that occur, these may help you estimate \\(\\lambda\\) in the exponential growth formula. Pay attention to the length of time that births and deaths are reported over, and what time of the year the population size is reported. Newcomb, HR. 1940. Ring-necked pheasant studies on Protection Island in the Strait of Juan de Fuca, Washington. MS thesis. Oregon State University. Noteably, Pheasant chicks are born during the summer. In May 1937, 10 pheasants were introduced to the island. Before the next breeding season there were 35. November 10, 1938 a census estimated 110 pheasants. October 13, 1939 a census estimated 400 pheasants. Between the 1938 and 1939 censuses, Newcomb observed that 17 adult birds died. During the 1938 nesting season there were 5.86 eggs/nest. 83.57% of eggs hatched. During the 1939 nesting season there were 8.73 eggs/nest. 64.58% hatched. During the 1939 nesting season: Average number of chicks per clutch was 6.93.\\(^1\\) You can assume the sex ratio is 50:50 male to female. Pheasants are a sexually reproducing species. \\(^1\\) Note that g. and h. appear to be contradictory. 4.2 Questions When considering an application to determine the correct values of \\(\\lambda\\) and \\(N_t\\) in the exponential growth formula, it helps to understand that for all mathematical formulas there must be the same units on both sides of the equals sign, and for each term that is added or subtracted. The units of the population size, \\(N_t\\), at time, \\(t\\), are number. The geometric growth rate, \\(\\lambda\\) is unitless. Choose an equation from Vandermeer and Gordon 2013 p1-3 and give the units for each of the terms to show that both sides of the equals have the same units. For example, for the equation from the last assignment: \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} N_t &amp; = &amp; N_0 \\lambda^t \\\\ \\left(\\mbox{number}\\right)&amp; =&amp;(\\mbox{number}) (\\mbox{unitless})^{weeks}\\\\ \\left(\\mbox{number}\\right)&amp; =&amp; \\left(\\mbox{number}\\right)\\\\ \\end{eqnarray*}\\] Note that: \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} &amp; \\bullet &amp; (\\mbox{unitless}) \\times (\\mbox{quantity with units}) = (\\mbox{quantity with units}) \\\\ &amp; \\bullet &amp; (\\mbox{unitless})^{(\\mbox{quantity})} = (\\mbox{unitless}) \\end{eqnarray*}\\] [2 marks] Although not stated in the Vandermeer and Gordon (2013) p1-3 reading, \\(\\lambda = 1 + b - d\\) where \\(b\\) is the per capita birth rate over one time step (i.e. one week for the lilipad example, or 1 year for the pheasant example), and \\(d\\) is the fraction of the population that dies over one time step. The number 1 is considered unitless. What must the units of \\(b\\) and \\(d\\) be? [1 mark] In the Vandermeer and Gordon (2013) p1-3 reading, \\(\\lambda = 2\\). Given that \\(\\lambda = 1 + b - d\\), what are some possible values of \\(b\\) and \\(d\\). Note that \\(d\\) is a fraction and must be \\(1 \\geq d \\geq 0\\) and \\(b&gt;0\\). [1 mark] Let \\(d\\) be the fraction of the population that dies each year. By considering a. to i. above, estimate \\(d\\) for the ring-tailed pheasant population on Protection Island. Remember \\(d\\) must be a fraction: you need to divide by the number of pheasants that could have died during the time period under consideration. Write down any assumptions you have made. For example, did you assume that the mortality rate for one year is then the same for other years?

The population is growing if after one time unit, there are more individuals than there are at time \\(t\\), i.e., \\(N_{t+1}&gt;N_t\\). For what values of \\(\\lambda\\) will the population grow? [Hint: If you find this question difficult, substitute some numbers to help you find the answer. Let \\(N_t=1\\) and then try some values of \\(\\lambda &gt; 0\\). Since you let, \\(N_t = 1\\), the population is growing if \\(N_{t+1}&gt;1\\).

The estimation of \\(b\\) for an exponential growth model is more subtle. First, \\(b\\) it is estimated as the number of births (occurring between \\(t\\) and \\(t+1\\)), divided by the number of individuals that could have given birth, \\(N_t\\). You might average this value across multiple years if sufficient data are available. Furthermore, to correctly project the future population size, we should understand that \\(b\\) is more than the number of individuals born, additionally these individuals must survive to the next time step. Given a.-i. estimate \\(b\\). Write down any assumptions you have made. [3 marks] Recall that \\(\\lambda = 1 + b-d\\).

Population Ecology: First Principles (Second Edition). Princeton University Press, Princeton, United States. p4-8. Link We now have two ways of describing how population size changes with time whereby each individual has the same average number of offspring per unit time and the same probability of dying. Discrete time geometric growth: \\[\\begin{equation} N_t = N_0\\lambda^t \\tag{7.1} \\end{equation}\\] and, Continuous time exponential growth: \\[\\begin{equation} N(t) = N(0)e^{rt} \\tag{7.2} \\end{equation}\\] Notably, for both these models the per capita birth and death rates do not change change over time, and do not change with density or age. The notation \\(N_t\\) and \\(N(t)\\) is conventional for discrete time versus continuous time formulations respectively, however, these notations both mean the same: the population size at a particular time, \\(t\\). When \\(t=0\\) we have the population size at time 0: \\(N_0\\) or \\(N(0)\\). As noted in the reading, when \\(\\lambda = e^{r}\\) the equations are the same. Note that \\(e\\) is the exponential function, exp() or \\(e^x\\). 7.2 Discrete or continuous time formulations Whether it is appropriate to model a population in a discrete time or continous time formulation depends on whether births and deaths are overlapping or neatly partitioned into a distinct time period. For example, for many animals there is a distinct breeding season: a short proportion of the year when offspring are born. As such, there is very little temporal overlap between the times of year when births and deaths occur. Humans are an example of a species that might reasonably be modelled as continuous time because babies are born year round. 7.3 Questions For what values of \\(r\\) does the population size increase over time? Note that \\(r\\) might be negative, and I am asking not if the population size, \\(N(t)\\) is positive, but if the population is increasing, i.e., if \\(N(t)\\) is getting larger in value over time. [1 mark] As described in the reading, \\(b\\) is a per capita birth rate, and \\(d\\) is a per capita death rate, and \\(r = b-d\\). For continuous time exponential growth, both \\(b\\) and \\(d\\) must be non-negative and can take any values bigger than 0. Note that this differs from the discrete time model formulation where \\(0 \\leq d \\leq 1\\). When \\(d &gt; 1\\) in the continuous time formulation, this means that the average lifespan is less than one time step (i.e., the average life span is \\(1/d\\)). For example, when \\(d = 2\\) this means that the average life expectancy for an individual is 1/2 a time step (i.e., days or year, however, the time unit is defined in the model). When the population size increases over time, what is true of \\(b\\) relative to \\(d\\)? [1 mark] For what value of \\(r\\) does \\(N(t)\\) not change over time? Hint: if \\(N(t)\\) is not changing then \\(N(t)=N(0)\\) for all \\(t\\). [1 mark] Consider the equation: \\[ \\frac{dN(t)}{dt} = rN(t). \\] As described in the reading, this is an alternative way to write the continuous time exponential growth equation. The quantity \\(\\frac{dN(t)}{dt}\\) can be understood as the slope of a graph where population size is on the vertical axis and time is on the horizontal axis. As such, if the slope is zero, \\(\\frac{dN(t)}{dt}=0\\), then the population size is not changing. If \\(\\frac{dN(t)}{dt}&lt;0\\), then the population size is decreasing. For what value of \\(r\\) does the population size decrease? What is true about \\(b\\) relative to \\(d\\) in this instance?

Population Ecology: First Principles (Second Edition). Princeton University Press, Princeton, United States. p1-17. Link Today is the first day of in-person learning. The classroom is SN-3060. The lecture will be live at the usual WebEx (see BrightSpace). I will record and upload to BrightSpace. 10.2 Questions Sketch a graph of the logistic growth equation, \\(\\frac{dN(t)}{dt} = rN(t)\\left(1 - \\frac{N(t)}{K}\\right)\\), with time, \\(t\\), on the horizontal axis (x-axis), and population size \\(N(t)\\), on the vertical (y-axis). Add to your graph a dashed line corresponding to the carrying capacity, \\(N(t) = K\\). Label on your graph, \\(N(0)\\): the population size at \\(t=0\\). As drawn in your graph, is \\(N(0)&lt;K\\)? i.e. is the population size at \\(t=0\\) less than the carrying capacity, \\(K\\)? As drawn, is \\(r &gt; 0\\)? i.e. is the net reproductive rate when the population size is small, positive? What does it mean if \\(r&lt;0\\) in terms of the per capita birth rate when the population size is small, \\(b\\), relative to the per capita death rate when the population size is small, \\(d\\)? If you answered ‘yes’ to c. add another line for \\(N(t)\\), but when \\(N(0)&gt;K\\) (assume \\(r&gt;0\\)). Note that \\(N(0)&gt;K\\) means that at time \\(t=0\\) the population size, \\(N(0)\\), is greater than the carrying capacity, \\(K\\). [3 marks] Draw a graph of a. exponential growth, \\(N(t) = N(0)e^{rt}\\) or \\(\\frac{dN(t)}{dt} = rN(t)\\) (both are the same equation), and b. logistic growth \\(\\frac{dN(t)}{dt} = rN(t)\\left(1 - \\frac{N(t)}{K}\\right)\\), where the value of \\(r\\) is the same for both a. and b. [1 mark] Draw a graph of logistic growth, where the population size is decreasing \\(\\frac{dN(t)}{dt}&lt;0\\), but positive \\(N(t)&gt;0\\). Give a condition on the initial value of \\(N(0)\\) or the per capita net reproductive rate when the population size is small, \\(r\\), such that the population size is decreasing, \\(\\frac{dN(t)}{dt}&lt;0\\), but positive, \\(N(t)&gt;0\\).

Link [Optional] Watch my derivation of logistic growth from Vandermeer and Goldberg. Link 11.2 Questions Give your own written derivation of the logistic growth equation where it arises due to food limitation. You might watch the video and write out the steps, or you might work through the reading, writing out the steps in your own words. You should start with the first equation in the video (or equation 12 in the reading) and end with the last equation in the video (or equation 17 in the video). You need to end with expressions for \\(r\\) and \\(K\\) in terms of the food/resource related parameters, \\(F_T\\), \\(c\\), and \\(b\\). You should write explanations such as “then, by substituting equation 1” or “then, by substituting \\(r = bF\\). You should give written descriptions of all the parameters, i.e.,”where \\(F\\) is the amount of food/resources\". [6 marks] Write one paragraph (3 to 5 sentences) explaining what has been the most important point about population dynamics that you have come to understand during the first few weeks of class. Anyone who attempts this question, and reflects on their experience in class to date will receive full marks. [2 marks] "]]
