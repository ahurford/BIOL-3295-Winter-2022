You have until Fri Jan 21 to submit your answers. 3.1 Required reading Vandermeer, J.H., Goldberg, D.E., 2013. Population Ecology: First Principles (Second Edition). Princeton University Press, Princeton, United States. p1-3. Link 3.2 Questions Suppose \\(\\lambda = 4\\) in equation (3) (see the required reading). Explain in 1-2 sentences the meaning of \\(\\lambda = 4\\). [1 mark] Suppose the number of lilypads during week 7 is 16,384. Let \\(\\lambda = 4\\), and assume that the units of \\(t\\) are weeks. Use equation (3) to calculate the number of lilypads in week 8. Show your calculations. [2 marks] Use your answer to question 2. to calculate the number of lilypads in week 9. Show your calculations. [2 marks] Equation (4) for the required reading assumes that \\(N_0=1\\), however, this formula can be generalized such that \\[ N_t = N_0\\lambda^t \\] where \\(N_t\\) is the population size at time, \\(t\\). Define time such that \\(t=0\\) is week 7 and \\(t\\) is then the number of weeks since week 7. Use the equation above to answer question 3 and confirm that the answer is the same (i.e., find the population size for week 9, when \\(\\lambda=4\\) and the population size for week 7 is 16,384). Show your calculations. [2 marks] Use the formula from question 4 to find the population size for week 15, where \\(N_0=1\\) and \\(\\lambda=4\\). Define time as the number of weeks since week 0. Show your calculations [2 marks] "]]
