# Thurs Feb 17: Age-structured population dynamics

Catch-up day. Everyone will recieve 100$\%$ for today's assignment. Nothing is required. I will be available in SN-3060, and by WebEx, to answer questions on other assignments that you have not yet completed. I wasn't able to connect to Wifi on Tuesday. I hope this problem doesn't continue.
