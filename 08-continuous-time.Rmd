# Tues Jan 25: Exponential growth - continuous time

The deadline to submit your answers is Tues Jan 31.

## Required reading
Vandermeer, J.H., Goldberg, D.E., 2013. Population Ecology: First Principles (Second Edition). Princeton University Press, Princeton, United States. p4-8. [Link](https://ebookcentral-proquest-com.qe2a-proxy.mun.ca/lib/mun/detail.action?docID=1205619)

Recall the equation for exponential growth:

\begin{equation}
N(t) = N(0)e^{rt}
(\#eq:Exp)
\end{equation}

## Questions

1. Calculate the formula for the doubling time for continuous time exponential growth (equation \@ref(eq:Exp)). This is the time for the population to double in size. The value of $N(0)$, the population size at $t=0$ doesn't matter as long as it is a positive number. When the population has doubled, $N(t) = 2N(0)$. To answer this question you need to find $t$ such that $N(t) = 2N(0)$. You may need to revisit some rules about working with logarithms to complete this question (i.e. see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithm), specifically the _Product, Quotient, Power, and Root_ table. Also recall, $Ln(e^x) = x$). Please show your work. [2 marks]

2. Consider the plot above. Let $N(0) = 10$. Using the formula \@ref(eq:Exp), with the value of $r$ such that deaths double every day, when $t$ = 10 days later, what is the value of $N(t)$? [check your answer matches the graph]

3. Let $N(0) = 10$. Using the formula \@ref(eq:Exp), with the value of $r$ such that deaths double every 3 days, when $t$ = 30 days later, what is the value of $N(t)$? [check your answer matches the graph]

4. Let $N(0) = 10$. Using the formula \@ref(eq:Exp), with the value of $r$ such that deaths double every 7 days, when $t$ = 35 days later, what is the value of $N(t)$? [check your answer matches the graph]
